I am currently pursuing my PhD in robotics at Stanford University (major in Aero/Astro, minor in Computer Science). I am advised by Dr. Mykel Kochenderfer in the [Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory](http://sisl.stanford.edu) and my research focuses on autonomous planning applications to safety-critical systems, namely autonomous vehicles and energy systems. I've worked in rocketry, interned in autonomous driving, and am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow. I was the head TA for the Stanford course on [Advanced Sequential Decision-Making](http://aa229.stanford.edu). In my spare time, I organize events for the Stanford graduate community. I also enjoy hiking, skiing, playing the violin, and travelling -- I've spent time living and studying in Spain (UPV), Germany (KIT), and Austria (Virtual Vehicle GmbH, Graz).
