Iâ€™m a founding research scientist at [Terra AI](https://www.terraai.com/), where I productionize AI systems for sustainable energy and natural resource development. I received my Ph.D. in autonomy (Aeronautics and Astronautics with a minor in Computer Science) from Stanford University in 2024, where I worked with [Prof. Mykel Kochenderfer](http://sisl.stanford.edu) on [planning under uncertainty in safety-critical systems](/files/dissertation.pdf). My research combines probabilistic machine learning, optimization, and control to enable automated decision-making in high-stakes domains such as autonomous vehicles and energy systems. Before joining Terra, I worked on financial systems at [BlackRock AI Labs](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/ai), autonomous driving at Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, and aerospace systems at SEG. I was an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, an Accel Fellow, and served as head teaching assistant for Stanford graduate courses on optimization and sequential decision-making.
